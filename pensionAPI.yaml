    # Pension-API (Deutsch)
    **** Deutsch (for English see below) ****
    Mit dem Pension-API können Daten zur versicherten Person und deren Vorsorgesituation abgefragt werden. Dies umfasst vereinfacht gesagt
    die Daten, die auf dem Versicherungsausweis zu finden sind. Auch die Erstellung bzw. das Beziehen von bereits erstellten
    Versicherungsausweisen als PDF-Datei ist möglich. Des Weiteren gibt es Endpunkte für Simulationen und für Transaktionen.
    Als Einstieg fürs Pension-API wird eine technische Personen-, Statement- oder Policen-ID benötigt.
    Die wesentlichen Objekte dieses APIs sind *Person*, *Police* und *Pension Statement*. Person bezieht sich immer auf eine natürliche
    Person, die bei einer Pensionskasse versichert ist.
    Die Police beschreibt den indirekten Versicherungsvertrag zwischen der versicherten Person (ArbeitnehmerIn) und der Pensionskasse. Ist
    eine Person über zwei Vorsorgepläne versichert, z.B. über einen Basis- und einen zusätzlichen Kaderplan, so hat sie zwei Policen.
    Das Pension Statement umfasst grundsätzlich die gleichen persönlichen Vorsorgedaten wie die Policen, kann aber die Daten verschiedener
    Policen aggregieren. Je nach Pensionkasse wird dies unterschiedlich gehandhabt.
    Die PDF-Version des Vorsorgeausweises entspricht dem Dokument, welches traditionell anfangs Jahr durch die Pensionskasse für die
    Versicherten ausgestellt wird.
    Das API umfasst auch Simulationen:
    - Änderung des Beschäftigtengrads und/oder des Lohns
    - Freiwilliger Einkauf in die Pensionskasse
    Die Simulationen berechnen die Effekte auf die monatlichen Beiträge sowie auf die voraussichtlichen Rentenleistungen bei
    unterschiedlichem Pensionierungsalter.
    Die in dieser Spezifikation angegebenen URLs sind nur Beispiel-URLs. Das API wird von einer Vielzahl von Pensionskassen implementiert
    und jede Pensionskasse hat eine andere Basis-URL für das API. Die Basis-URL der jeweiligen Pensionskasse wird vom Directory API
    geliefert.
    ## Simulation
    Die Simulation berechnet, wie hoch das Altersguthaben und die Rente mit und ohne Einkauf sein wird. Dabei können verschiedene Parameter
    gewählt werden:
    - Einkaufssumme (gesamt)
    - Pensionierungsalter
    - Betrag pro Zahlung (bei mehreren Zahlungen)
    - Zahlungsperiodizität (bei mehreren Zahlungen)
    - Datum der (ersten) Zahlung
    Die Simulation geht davon aus, dass die gesetzlichen Voraussetzungen für den Einkauf gegeben sind. Sie prüft, dass der maximale
    Einkaufsbetrag nicht überschritten wird, und passt ihn bei Bedarf an.
    ## Kontobewegung
    Das Kontobewegungsendpunkte liefert die Kontobewegungen des Altersguthabens einer Police.
    # Pension API (English)
    **** English (für Deutsch siehe weiter oben) ****
    The Pension API serves to query details about the insured person and their pension situation. In simplified terms, this includes the
    data found on the insurance certificate. Additionally, policy statements can be generated or already generated statements can be
    retrieved as PDF files. There are also endpoints for simulations and for transactions.
    Person, statement and policy IDs serve as the entry point for this API.
    The main objects of this API are *Person*, *Policy* and *Pension Statement*. Person always refers to a natural person who is insured
    with a pension fund.
    The policy describes the indirect insurance contract between the insured person (employee) and the pension fund. If a person is insured
    under two pension plans, e.g. via a basic plan and an additional management plan, he or she has two policies.
    The pension statement basically contains the same personal pension data as the policies, but can aggregate the data from different
    policies. This is handled differently depending on the pension fund.
    The PDF version of the pension certificate corresponds to the document that is traditionally issued to the insured persons by the
    pension fund at the beginning of the year.
    The API also includes simulations:
    - Change of employment level and/or salary
    - Voluntary purchase into the pension fund
    The simulations calculate the effects on the monthly contributions as well as the effects of the perspective pension benefits for
    different retirement ages.
    The URLs in the specification are examples only. The API is implemented by a many pension funds and each pension fund has an individual
    base URL for the API. The base URL of a specific pension fund is provided by the directory API.
    ## Simulation
    The simulation calculates the prospective retirement capital and pension with and without voluntary purchase. Several parameters of the
    simulation can be specified:
    - Purchase amount (total)
    - Pension age
    - Amount of individual payments (if several payments are made towards a purchase)
    - Payment frequency (if several payments are made towards a purchase)
    - Date of (first) payment
    The simulation assumes that the legal prerequisites for the purchase are fulfilled. It checks that the maximum purchase amount is not
    exceeded and modifies it if needed.
    ## Transactions
    The Transactions endpoints provide the transactions affecting the retirement capital of a policy.

        For periodic payments, the simulation assumes that the payments are made with the specified payment size and payment frequency until
        the maximum purchase amount has been exhausted or the retirement date has been reached (whichever is first).
        If the retirement date is reached before the purchase amount is exhausted, the returned effective purchase amount will be lower than
        both the requested and the maximum purchase amount.
        Using a very high amount (e.g. CHF 10 million), it is possible to query the maximum purchase amount and the maximum additional

        occurred on the same date, they are ordered such that adding the transaction amount to the previous transactions balance results in
        the balance provided by the current transaction.
        The first transaction in the list is a pseudo transaction providing the carryover balance from the previous period. It is the only
        transaction with the category `carryover`.
        The `from` date must be before or be equal to the `to` date.
        The result contains a date range as well. It is usually equal to the request date range. However, if the requested `from` date is
        before the start of the policy or if the request `to` date is in the future, the date range may be adjusted to reflect the effective
        date range.
