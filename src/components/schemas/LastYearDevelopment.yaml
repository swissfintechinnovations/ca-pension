  Details about the capital development for the last year.

  In most cases, all fields should be populated with actual values reflecting the previous calendar year.
  However, if the insured person joined during the current year, some or all of the fields 
  may be missing due to the absence of a full year of history.

  Consumers of this data should account for potentially missing values in such cases.
