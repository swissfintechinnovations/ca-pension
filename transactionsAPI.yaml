      description: |
        Retrieves all transactions affecting the policy's retirement capital in the specified
        date range.

        The resulting transaction list is sorted in chronological order, starting with the oldest
        transaction. If several transactions occurred on the same date, they are ordered such that
        adding the transaction amount to the previous transactions balance results in the balance
        provided by the current transaction.

        The first transaction in the list is a pseudo transaction providing the carryover balance
        from the previous period. It is the only transaction with the category `carryover`.

        The `from` date must be before or be equal to the `to` date.

        The result contains a date range as well. It is usually equal to the request date range.
        However, if the requested `from` date is before the start of the policy or if the
        request `to` date is in the future, the date range may be adjusted to reflect the
        effective date range.
